This page is a 3 question trivia game about the creator, with a bonus question. The first three questions are yes or no questions, while the last uses a do while loop to keep asking the question till you get the correct answer.

Rick Stoner helped me debug the logical operators in my do while loop.

1/7/16 Moved questions into functions and responses to the first 3 questions are now added to the website.
       Elena Saygo was the driver for this pair programming exercise.
